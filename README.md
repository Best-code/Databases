# Relational Database Project

## Overview
This repository contains the work of Colin Maloney, Imran Ahmed, and Hugh Long for our Database class project. We are designing and implementing a relational database to address a specific problem domain. The project involves all phases of database development, including planning, design, implementation, and testing.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:
- To design a robust relational database schema.
- To implement the schema using SQL.
- To ensure data integrity and normalization.
- To demonstrate the use of advanced queries, joins, and transactions.
- To document the process and results effectively.

## Features
- **Schema Design**: Logical and physical database design to represent entities and relationships.
- **Data Normalization**: Ensuring the database adheres to 3NF or higher.
- **SQL Implementation**: Creating tables, views, stored procedures, and triggers.
- **Sample Data**: Populating the database with meaningful test data.
- **Complex Queries**: Examples of multi-join queries, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
- **Transaction Management**: Demonstrating ACID properties.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive details about the database, its use cases, and the SQL queries.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: 
- **Programming Language**: 
- **SQL**: For database operations and queries.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for collaboration and versioning.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Best-Code/Databses.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Databases
   ```
3. Import the database schema:
   ```bash
   ```

## How to Use
1. Load the schema into your DBMS.
2. Populate the database with sample data using the provided scripts.
3. Execute queries to test functionality and explore the database.
4. Modify and extend the database as required.
