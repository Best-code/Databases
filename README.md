# Relational Database Project FSU

## Overview
This repository contains the work of Colin Maloney, Imran Ahmed, and Hugh Long for our Database class project. We are designing and implementing a relational database to address a specific problem domain. The project involves all phases of database development, including planning, design, implementation, and testing.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:
- To design a robust relational database schema.
- To implement the schema using SQL.
- To ensure data integrity and normalization.
- To demonstrate the use of advanced queries, joins, and transactions.
- To document the process and results effectively.

## Features
- **Schema Design**: Logical and physical database design to represent entities and relationships.
- **Data Normalization**: Ensuring the database adheres to 3NF or higher.
- **SQL Implementation**: Creating tables, views, stored procedures, and triggers.
- **Sample Data**: Populating the database with meaningful test data.
- **Complex Queries**: Examples of multi-join queries, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
- **Transaction Management**: Demonstrating ACID properties.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive details about the database, its use cases, and the SQL queries.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**:
- **Programming Language**: 
- **SQL**: For database operations and queries.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for collaboration and versioning.
